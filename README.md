A collection of utilities / functions I find useful when working with <b>NodeJS</b>.

I don't want a 1000 different packages looked up and installed each time I start a project, so I made this for quick and easy install to give me what I consider the essentials and get on with development.


<br>

#### <b>Want the version for websites? https://github.com/DarceyLloyd/AFTC.js

<br>


## <b>Details</b>
I don't want to go hunting for the latest and greates libraries or utilities all the time, so this gets deployed before any development starts and I know if I need file io, download, debug, development utilities 


## Installation
```
npm install aftc.node.libs
```




## Usage
```
const aftc = require("aftc.node.libs.js");

const log = aftc.log;
// no more typing console.log just log

const logr = aftc.logr;
// red text output and reset to the console

const logg = aftc.logg;
// green text output and reset to the console

const logy = aftc.logy;
// yellow text output and reset to the console
```



I am in the early stages of implementing all that is available in AFTC.js for the NodeJS version, full will be completed soon.
